      You will be evaluating how well a summary captures the intentions of a user's query.

      Here is the user's original query:
      <query>
      "$QUERY"
      </query>

      Please read the query carefully to understand what the user's intentions are.

      Here is a summary that attempts to capture the intentions of the query:
      <summary>
      "$SUMMARY"
      </summary>

      Please extract the intentions captured in the summary. Note that if there are multiple intentions,
      they will be separated by && signs.

      Now, compare the intentions you identified from the original query to the intentions captured in the
      summary. Determine how well you think the summary covers the key intentions from the query.

      Write a short explanation of your reasoning in 20 words or less inside <reasoning> tags.

      Finally, provide an integer score from 0 to 100 inside <score> tags indicating how well the summary captures
      the query's intentions, with 0 meaning not at all, and 100 meaning it fully captures all of the query's intentions.
